# grpc-samples
This repo contains samples of GRPC, inspired by https://www.udemy.com/course/grpc-golang/learn/lecture/11018756#overview

Each sub-directory contains a GRPC proto, as well as a corresponding client and server. They are:
* Greet &rarr; A GreetService, to facilitate messages between people
* Calculator &rarr; A Calculator Service, to assist in calculations
